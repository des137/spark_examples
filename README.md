# Examples of PySpark scripts

(This repository contains a few pyspark scripts that I use for reference at work. It contains both the basic data wrangling and machine learning scripts.)

In the world of big data, **[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)** has emerged as the ultimate unified analytics engine that can cut through billions of records. Data scientists usually need not know the implementation details behind the deployment, but should be familiar with the basic syntax that is used for data exploration and wrangling and creating machine learning models. The aim of this repository is to collect the basic Spark syntax/commands written with *[PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/)* (*Python* API for spark). 

1. **spark_basics** contains basic commands used for data exploration/data wrangling steps.
2. **ml_models** contains a few basic machine learning algorithms implemented using the SparkML library.
