# Simple Examples of PySpark scripts

In the world of big data. **[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)** has emerged as the ultimate unified analytics engine that can cut through billions of records in a distributed way. Data scientists usually need not know the implementation details behind the deployment, but should be familiar with the basic syntax that is used for data exploration and wrangling, as well as, building machine learning models. The aim of this repository is to collect the basic Spark syntax/commands originally developed in *scala*, but implemented through, *[PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/)* (*Python* API for spark). 

1. **spark_basics** contains basic commands used for data exploration/data wrangling steps.
2. **ml_models** contains a few basic machine learning algorithms implemented using the SparkML library.
